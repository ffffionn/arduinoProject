# Arduino Burglar Alarm

As part of our 'C Programming for Microcontrollers' module, we were given the task of creating a model Burglar Alarm that observed 4 different areas with configurable options for triggering the alarm in each. An external library we used in the implementation is included in the repo.

### Controls: 
  - Power  (Save User Settings)
  - Mode   (Change a zone's mode)
  - Mute   (Clear User Settings)
  - -      (Read device log)
  - +      (Show stats for a zone)
